# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**A kinetic model of the cyclin E/Cdk2 developmental timer in Xenopus laevis embryos.**   
Ciliberto A, Petrus MJ, Tyson JJ, Sible JC. _Biophys Chem_ 2003 Jul
1;104(3):573-89 [12914904](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12914904) ,  
**Abstract:**   
Early cell cycles of Xenopus laevis embryos are characterized by rapid
oscillations in the activity of two cyclin-dependent kinases. Cdk1 activity
peaks at mitosis, driven by periodic degradation of cyclins A and B. In
contrast, Cdk2 activity oscillates twice per cell cycle, despite a constant
level of its partner, cyclin E. Cyclin E degrades at a fixed time after
fertilization, normally corresponding to the midblastula transition. Based on
published data and new experiments, we constructed a mathematical model in
which: (1) oscillations in Cdk2 activity depend upon changes in
phosphorylation, (2) Cdk2 participates in a negative feedback loop with the
inhibitory kinase Wee1; (3) cyclin E is cooperatively removed from the
oscillatory system; and (4) removed cyclin E is degraded by a pathway
activated by cyclin E/Cdk2 itself. The model's predictions about embryos
injected with Xic1, a stoichiometric inhibitor of cyclin E/Cdk2, were
experimentally validated.
